# Accessibility at edX

.subtitle[All-hands: July 26, 2016]

.thirdtitle[Accessibility training season is upon us!]

---

class: title middle right

## Why are we here?

.subtitle[Unlock mysteries]

.thirdtitle[Reveal obligations]

---

### What we will cover

* *Basic* introduction to accessibility
* Accessibility at edX
* Overview of legal obligations
* Upcoming DOJ deliverables
* Updated training course for 2016
* Practical accessibility training/demo (time permitting)
  
---

### What is accessibility?

<blockquote style="border-left: 8px solid #019cfc;padding-left:1em;margin-left:0;font-style:italic">The degree to which a product, service or environment is available to a person</blockquote>

* A *relative* term
* Can be *direct*
* Can be *indirect* (Assistive Technology or AT)
* Is synonymous with *quality*
* Often achieved by giving users *choice*
* *A high quality product is accessible to **as many people as possible***

---
name: iphone

### Case Study: Apple iPhone

.float-right.scale25[![iPhone 6 in various sizes and colors.](assets/iphone.jpg)]

*Arguably one of the most intuitive hardware and software products available to the public*

* Grandmothers can send text messages
* Toddlers can make in-app purchases

<div style="display: block; clear:both"></div>
---

template: iphone

.float-right.scale30[![Image of 3 smiling iphone users, who happen to be blind, sitting on a couch.](assets/blind-iphone.jpg)]

* Accessible
 * Used by 70% of blind smartphone users
 * Makes hardware-based Assistive Technology a thing of the past

---
### How does quality = accessibility?

* Intuitive to use
* Customizable 
* Gives users options/choice
 
#### Where do we start?

Helps to think of Human-Computer Interaction as simply:
  
* Input
* Output

---
### A brief history of...

.float-right.scale50[![Screenshot of terminal as seen in Movie Wargames.](assets/falken.jpg)]

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

Back in the olden days:

* Input
  * Text
* Output
  * Text

---
### Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

.float-right.scale50[![Screenshot of windows 3.1.](assets/win31.png)]

Introduced some accessibility challenges:

* Input
  * Support for pointing devices
* Output
  * Support for images, video, audio, PDF, spreadsheets, simulations

---
### Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

.float-right.scale50[![Image of Tom Cruise controlling computer with gestures in Minority Report.](assets/tomcruise.jpg)]

Solutions:

* Input
  * Always support the keyboard
* Output
  * Always make available as text

---
### Keyboard support (Input)

* It's how it was done from the beginning
* If it works with a keyboard, it works for things that emulate a keyboard
  * Joysticks
  * Sip-and-puff
  * Speech input
  * On-screen keyboards
  * Gesture-based input devices

---
### Text all the things (Output)

Text can:

* be transformed into sound,
* be transformed into touch,
* be translated into other languages,
* become smaller or larger,
* change color,
* be assigned meta (magical) properties through the power of markup,
* be read by machines!

*Understanding these basic challenges and solutions will make more advanced accessibility concepts easier to understand.*

## WCAG 2.0 AA

.subtitle[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0]

.thirdtitle[How we measure conformance]

---
### WCAG 2.0 

Technical set of guidelines published by the W3C in 2008

* 4 Principles
* 12 Guidelines
* 65 Success Criteria - Testable Statements
  * (38 applicable to Level AA)
* Hundreds of Techniques and supporting documents

---

### WCAG 2.0 Core Principles

* **Perceivable:**<br>Content must be presented in a way that all users can perceive it
* **Operable:**<br>Components and navigation must be operable
* **Understandable:**<br>Information and navigation must be understandable
* **Robust:**<br>Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents including assistive technology

---

### Principle 1: Perceivable

* 1.1 Text Alternatives: Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.
* 1.2 Time-based Media: Provide alternatives for time-based media.
* 1.3 Adaptable: Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.
* 1.4 Distinguishable: Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.

---

### Principle 2: Operable

* 2.1 Keyboard Accessible: Make all functionality available from a keyboard.
* 2.2 Enough Time: Provide users enough time to read and use content.
* 2.3 Seizures: Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures.
* 2.4 Navigable: Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.

---

### Principle 3: Understandable

* 3.1 Readable: Make text content readable and understandable.
* 3.2 Predictable: Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.
* 3.3 Input Assistance: Help users avoid and correct mistakes.

---

### Principle 4: Robust

* 4.1 Compatible: Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.
