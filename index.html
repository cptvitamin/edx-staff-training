# Accessibility Training

.subtitle[All-hands: September 8, 2015]

.thirdtitle[Introduction]

---

class: title middle right

## Why are we here?

.subtitle[Unlock mysteries]

.thirdtitle[Reveal obligations]

---

### Agenda

* Basic introduction to accessibility
* Accessibility at edX
* Overview of legal obligations
* ***Edge training course***
* Practical accessibility training/demo (time permitting)
  
---

### What is accessibility?

<blockquote style="border-left: 8px solid #019cfc;padding-left:1em;margin-left:0;font-style:italic">The degree to which a product, service or environment is available to a person</blockquote>

* A *relative* term
* Can be *direct*
* Can be *indirect* (Assistive Technology or AT)
* Is synonymous with *quality*
* Often achieved by giving users *choice*
* *A high quality product is accessible to **as many people as possible***

name: iphone

### iPhone

.float-right.scale25[![iPhone 6 in various sizes and colors.](assets/iphone.jpg)]

*Arguably one of the most intuitive hardware and software products*

* Great-grandmas can use it
* Toddlers can figure it out

<div style="display: block; clear:both"></div>
---

template: iphone

.float-right.scale30[![Image of 3 smiling iphone users, who happen to be blind, sitting on a couch.](assets/blind-iphone.jpg)]

* Accessible
 * Used by 70% of blind smartphone users
 * Makes hardware-based Assistive Technology unnecessary

---
### How does quality = accessibility?

* Intuitive to use
* Customizable 
* Gives users options/choice
  * Input
  * Output

---
### Human-Computer Interaction

Problems:

* Input
  * Support for too few (mouse)
* Output
  * Support for too many (images, video, audio, PDF, spreadsheets, simulations)

---
### Human-Computer Interaction

Solutions:

* Input
  * Support the keyboard
* Output
  * Text all the things

---
### Keyboard support (Input)

* It's how it was done from the beginning
* If it works with a keyboard, it works for things that emulate a keyboard
  * Joysticks
  * Sip-and-puff
  * Speech input
  * On-screen keyboards

---
### Text all the things (Output)

Text can:

* be transformed into sound,
* be transformed into touch,
* be translated into other languages,
* become smaller or larger,
* change color,
* be assigned meta (magical) properties through the power of markup,
* be read by machines!

## Questions?

---

class: title middle right

## Web Content Accessibility 

.subtitle[*In plain English*]

---

class: shift-down

## Text

* is accessible
* is translatable
* .highlight[can be read by *software*] (like Assistive Technology)
* can be transformed into other formats

---
class: title middle right shift-up

### Problem: All text is created equal

.subtitle[Solution: Markup to the rescue!]

.thirdtitle[*By itself, text has no semantic value*]

---

### Why is markup so important?

.highlight[*Software is really good at reading markup*]

* Assistive Technology (AT) relies on markup to determine the "role" the text plays
* AT provides [shortcuts](http://doccenter.freedomscientific.com/doccenter/archives/training/jawskeystrokes.htm) to interact with markup
* AT users benefit *greatly* from these shortcuts
* Without proper markup, its just giant blobs of text

---

### Semantic Markup

What "role" does the text play?

* Is it a .highlight[heading]?
* Is it a list, or an item in a .highlight[list]?
* Is it a .highlight[link]?
* An .highlight[iframe]?
* Just a .highlight[paragraph]?
* Does it identify a column or row in a .highlight[table]?

*AT provides direct and enhanced access to all of these (and more). This functionality is not possible without the right markup.*

---

### Headings

* All AT provides multiple ways for users to browse by heading (examples):
  * Next heading (at any level)
  * Next level 3 heading
  * First heading
  * First level 2 heading
  
.highlight[Logical order is important]
  
*This won't work if your text just looks like a heading*

### This is a level 3 heading

.fake-heading[This is not a level 3 heading]  

---
layout: true

### Links

---

.float-right.scale50[![Screenshot of links list in Voiceover](assets/mIsec.png)]

* All AT provides multiple ways of navigating between links on a page:
  * By tabbing (of course)
  * In an .highlight[interactive list]
   * Where links can be directly accessed by .highlight[how they are spelled] or their .highlight[order in the document]

---
  
Bad:

* [Click here](#) to register
* Article teaser [More...](#)
* [Download](#) the white paper

Good:

* [Register for edX training](#)
* [What is accessible content: Full Text](#)
* [Download the PDF textbook](#)

---
layout: false

### Color contrast

* Minimum contrast ratio of 4.5 to 1
* Large text can have a ratio of 3 to 1
    * 18pt and 14pt bold<br>(roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150% )
    
  <p style="font-size: 18pt">This is 18pt text</p>
  <p style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: bold;">This is 14pt bold</p>
  
*Contrast ratios or nearly impossible to analyze without the help of [color contrast analyzing tools/software](#tools)*

## Images

.subtitle[We need to text all the images, too!]

.thirdtitle[The ALT Attribute]

---
### Text alternatives (using the alt attribute)

* Can be rendered through any sensory modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile) to match the needs of the user.
* Authoring useful alt attribute content requires the author to carefully consider the .highlight[context] in which the image appears and the .highlight[function] that image may have in that context.
* Needs to be an appropriate .highlight[functional replacement] for the image.
* Can't be too long or require additional markup

---

### How do I determine what is *useful* alt content? 

*A good place to start is by asking the following questions:*

* Why is the image being included in a page? 
* What is its purpose?
* Does it provide useful information?
* Does it perform a function? 
* Is it a label for an interactive element?
* Is it purely decorative?

*Answers to these questions can help you use a simple decision tree:*
 
---

### Is this image the only content of a link or form control?

**Yes:** 
       
.float-right.center[![Screenshot of Introduction to Linux course card with an arrow highlighting the image linked to the course intro video](assets/EFAou.png)<br>![Screenshot of various social icons](assets/7xE4S.png)]
   
Use the alt attribute communicate the destination of the link or action taken

*A good alt value for this image would be "Watch the 'Introduction to Linux' course video", which describes the action, not the image.*
        
**No:** Next slide!

---

### Does this image contain text?

**Yes:** 
 
.float-right.scale40[![Screenshot of stylized text that represents the 3 main topics on the page, verbatim](assets/T2axY.png)]
       
* If the text in the image is also present as real text nearby, .highlight[use an empty alt attribute] to hide the image from screen reader users.

* If the text in the image is just for visual effect, use an empty alt attribute.

* Otherwise, use the alt attribute to include the communicative text of the image.
        
**No:** Next slide! 
 
---

### Does this image contain text?

**Yes:** 
 
.float-right.scale40[![Screenshot of computer code transparently overlaying a computer keyboard](assets/LFS01_Ch0_Screen7.jpg)]
             
* If the text in the image is also present as real text nearby, use an empty alt attribute to hide the image from screen reader users.
 
* If the text in the image is just for visual effect, .highlight[use an empty alt attribute].

* Otherwise, use the alt attribute to include the communicative text of the image.
        
**No:** Next slide!

---

### Does this image contain text?

**Yes:** 

<figure class="float-right scale40">
  <img src="assets/fGqVI.png" alt="Screenshot of stylized text illustrating 3 points">
  <figcaption>Appropriate alt for this image would be: "1: Things change in linux. 2: We've repeated some things in the class. 3: We've tried to avoid holy wars."</figcaption>
</figure>
             
* If the text in the image is also present as real text nearby, use an empty alt attribute to hide the image from screen reader users.
        
* If the text in the image is just for visual effect, use an empty alt attribute.

* Otherwise, use the alt attribute to .highlight[include the communicative text of the image].
        
**No:** Next slide! 

---

### Does the image contribute meaning to the current page or context?

* **Yes**, and it’s a simple graphic or photograph: .highlight[the alt attribute should briefly describe the image in a way that conveys that meaning].
* **Yes**, and it’s a graph or complex piece of information: .highlight[include the information contained in the image elsewhere on the page].
* **Yes**, but a suitable alt text is unknown at the time of publication (for example on a photo upload site): .highlight[provide an alt attribute or caption for the image that includes as much useful information as possible].
        
**No:**

Next slide!
 
---

### Is the image purely decorative or not intended for the user?
        
* Use an .highlight[empty alt attribute].  This will make it invisible to a screen reader user.

## Video

* All sound needs to have a textual equivalent
  * Timed Text Captions
  * Transcript

* All on screen text needs to have an audible equivalent
  * Non-text content that is important to the context of the video must also have an audible equivalent<br>
